            <p>The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.</p>
            <p>During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.</p>

         <div>
            <p>JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 98% of all websites (midâ€“2022) using it for this purpose.</p>

            <p>Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.</p>
            <p>Examples of scripted behavior:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.</li>
               <li>Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.</li>
               <li>Playing browser games.</li>
               <li>Controlling the playback of streaming media.</li>
               <li>Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.</li>
            </ul>

         <div>
            
            <p>The following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise.</p>

            <p>JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with var; block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.</p>

            <p>JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency.</p>

            <p>For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.</p>

         </div>

         <div>

         <p> 
Variables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var, let or const keywords. Variables defined without keywords will be defined at the global scope</p>
         
         <code>
            // Declares a function-scoped variable named `x`, and implicitly assigns the
// special value `undefined` to it. Variables without value are automatically
// set to undefined.
// var is generally considered bad practice and let and const are usually preferred.
var x;

         </code>

         <p>However, most runtime environments have a console object that can be used to print output.
         </p>

         <code>
            console.log("Hello, World!");
         </code>

         <p>In HTML documents, a program like this is required for an output:</p>
         
      
            <code>// Text nodes can be made using the "write" method.
// This is frowned upon, as it can overwrite the document if the document is fully loaded.
document.write('foo');</code>

         <p>A simple recursive function to calculate the factorial of a natural number:</p>
         
      
            <code>function factorial(n) {
    // Checking the argument for legitimacy. Factorial is defined for positive integers.
    if (isNaN(n)) {
        console.error("Non-numerical argument not allowed.");
        return NaN; // The special value: Not a Number
    }
    if (n === 0)
        return 1; // 0! = 1
    if (n < 0)
        return undefined; // Factorial of negative numbers is not defined.
    if (n % 1) {
        console.warn(`${n} will be rounded to the closest integer. For non-integers consider using gamma function instead.`);
        n = Math.round(n);
    }
    // The above checks need not be repeated in the recursion, hence defining the actual recursive part separately below.

    // The following line is a function expression to recursively compute the factorial. It uses the arrow syntax introduced in ES6.
    const recursivelyCompute = a => a > 1 ? a * recursivelyCompute(a - 1) : 1; // Note the use of the ternary operator `?`.
    return recursivelyCompute(n);
}

factorial(3); // Returns 6</code>


         <p>An anonymous function (or lambda):</p>
         
      
            <code>const counter = function() {
    let count = 0;
    return function() {
        return ++count;
    }
};</code>
